HeavyWeatherReader (HWR) parses data file output by the La Crosse Weather Station (WS)
software for storage in a MySQL DB. HWR maintains a persistent connection to
MySQL while it is active. Control+C (SIGINT) is the proper method to exit HWR.

Subsequently, HWR_WUnderground (HWR_WU) reads data stored by HWR and uploads it to 
WeatherUnderground. Format complies by the WU API format doc:
    http://wiki.wunderground.com/index.php/PWS_-_Upload_Protocol

HWR was written to support source weather data generated by:
    "Standard Version Heavy Weather PC Interface Software For WS-2800 Series"
    Heavy Weather Pro 2800 (HWP)
    http://www.lacrossetechnology.com/alerts/pws/software/setup_hw_wv5_us-1.5.4.exe
    http://www.lacrossetechnology.com/support/software.php

Data Flow:
    _La Crosse Temp-Hygro/Wind/Rain Sensors_ -> _La Crosse WS_ -> Windows 7 PC running _HWPro_
    -> _HWR_ -> MySQL -> _HWR_WU_ -> WUnderground.com

IMPORTANT NOTE for La Crosse WS PC SOFTWARE:
  Unless the "Heavy Weather Pro WS 2800" application is in the foreground on your PC,
  you will *probably* at most, receive weather station updates every 60 seconds (or 5
  minutes by default). Maximum observed updates at 13 second intervals.
